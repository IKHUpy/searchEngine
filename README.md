### About
The FutureSearchEngine is an open-source project aimed at developing a powerful and versatile search engine that can be easily integrated into a larger, undisclosed project. The primary focus of this repo is to provide an efficient and scalable search functionality, which will serve as a prerequisite for the next phase of the entire project. By leveraging the power of web scraping and refining data, this search engine is designed to be simple yet impactful, benefiting both users and content creators or developers.

This search engine is optimized to help users find what they are looking for on websites or platforms that have pages with headers. Headers play a key role in identifying and locating the relevant content. The content found under these headers will serve as data references, streamlining the search process and ensuring an enjoyable user experience.
